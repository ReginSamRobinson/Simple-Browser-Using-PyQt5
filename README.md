# Simple-Browser-Using-PyQt5
The code in Browserpy.py implements a simple tabbed web browser using PyQt5 and QtWebEngine. The browser features navigation controls (back, forward, reload, home), tab management, bookmarking, and a toggle for dark mode. Bookmarks are stored in memory for the session, and the interface is styled for both light and dark themes.
